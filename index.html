The Registered User is not entitled to royalty payments or any other compensation or fee related to such UGC. We may freely use and transfer the UGC. Our non-exclusive access to freely use the UGC applies irrevocably without any time limitation and without territorial limitations.</p> <p>2.2 &nbsp;Registered Users are liable for the UGC they publish on the Website.</p> <p>2.3 &nbsp;Registered Users warrant that all UGC posted on the Website is correct and true (where they state facts) or genuinely held (where they state opinions).</p> <p>2.4 &nbsp;UGC must relate to a company or an organisation from which the Registered User has purchased or can otherwise document using the company&rsquo;s or organisation&rsquo;s products or services.</p> <p>2.5 &nbsp;You may not publish UGC regarding companies to which you have personal or professional relations.</p> <p>2.6 &nbsp;Registered Users must not publish UGC on the website which</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">is unlawful, deceptive, misleading, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, tortious, obscene, pornographic or profane,</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">has sexist, political or racial character,</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">violates other people&rsquo;s rights, including any intellectual property rights,</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">is offensive or in any way breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation,</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">violates these User Terms, including the User Guidelines,</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">has a disloyal or unlawful purpose and/or content (or promotes unlawful purposes),</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">is technically harmful (including without limitation computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan horses, worms, harmful components, corrupted data or other malicious software, harmful data or conduct).</li> </ul> <p>2.7 &nbsp;Contributors of UGC warrant in every context that the UGC is lawful and in compliance with the User Terms. If we receive notice or otherwise become aware that UGC violates current legislation and/or the User Terms, we may delete the UGC without any notice, and we - dependent on the character of the violation - may inform the violated party and/or the authorities of the violation. Our right to delete will not be conditioned on an explanation, although we will strive to inform the Registered User about the deletion and the reason hereof.</p> <p>2.8 &nbsp;The Registered User hereby grants us the right to initiate and take any legal actions which we deem necessary in case of infringement of the Registered Users UGC.</p> <p>2.9 &nbsp;The Registered User must guarantee to indemnify us for any claims which may be made against us as a consequence of the Registered User&rsquo;s violation of the User Terms or current legislation.
