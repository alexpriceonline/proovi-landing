UK data protection laws govern collection of data by Proovi.</p> <p>3.2 The information for which you are the data controller</p> <p>You shall be data controller of the content you choose to disclose on the Website and for the data disclosed on your profile on Social Networks, which is the consequence of the connection of your profile on the Website with your profile on the Social Network.</p> <p>3.3 Links to websites</p> <p>The Website contains links to other websites.

Proovi regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
